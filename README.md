# JEMOA
Java Evolutionary Multi-Objective Algorithms, this version was developed with Java 11.
# Data type

   * Interval 
   * Fuzzy Number (Trapezoidal)
# Problems
  *  PSP

   * Electre Tri
   * INTERCLASS-nC
   * INTERCLASS-nB
   * SatClassifier
# Execution DTLZ Test
To compile and run from command line the test suite it is necessary to execute the following maven goal:
```
$ mvn clean compile package 
```
For run
```
$ java -jar jemoa-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -a NSGAIII -m 3   
```
It is required to have a directory -relative to the execution directory- with the instances in the following form:
```
DTLZ_INSTANCES/numberOfObjectives/DTLZ$N$_Instance.txt
```
Where N is the number of DTLZ problem.

# Examples
There are examples of how to execute each algorithm in the EXAMPLE package, it is only necessary to execute the class of interest, this from an IDE.
